1. Develop an Approach Document Suggesting the Parameters Considered for Providing Insights
Key Parameters:
			*	Satisfaction Rating: Measures customer satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 5.
			*Speed of Answer: Time taken by agents to answer a call.
			*	Resolution Status: Whether the customer's issue was resolved or not.
			*	Call Duration: Total time spent on a call.
			*Weekday & Hour: Helps identify peak call volumes based on the time of day and day of the week.
			*Agent Performance: Includes the number of calls handled by each agent and their associated satisfaction ratings.
2. Cleaning and Transforming the Data
				Handling Missing Data:
				Filled missing values for columns like Satisfaction rating, Speed of answer, and AvgTalkDuration.
				Removed rows where essential data (e.g., Resolved, Answered) was missing.
				Data Transformation:
				Converted date and time columns into a single datetime field for easier analysis.
				Calculated new variables such as Response Time (difference between time of call answered and call start time).
				Aggregated AvgTalkDuration to get topic-wise average durations for better insights.
				Categorical Encoding:
				Encoded categorical variables like Topic and Agent to numerical formats to perform analysis.
3. Analyze the Data, Visualize, and Generate Insights
Data Analysis:
					Correlation Analysis: Identified relationships between call attributes like Speed of Answer, AvgTalkDuration, and Satisfaction Rating.
Trend Analysis: Analyzed call volumes and satisfaction ratings across different weekdays and times.
Visualization:
			Created visualizations such as heatmaps for call distribution, boxplots for call duration across topics, and bar charts for agent performance.
Insights:
					#Satisfaction Rating Distribution: Most customers rated calls as 3/5, indicating neutral experiences. Suggested further investigation into improving the 5/5 ratings.
					#Call Duration by Topic: Calls on technical support and contract-related topics were longer, suggesting the need for better training or streamlined workflows for these topics.
					#Response Time & Satisfaction: Faster response times correlated with higher customer satisfaction, leading to the recommendation to keep response times under 90 seconds.
					#Peak Call Volumes: Identified peak call hours (9 AM - 12 PM and 4 PM - 6 PM) and recommended adjusting staffing levels during these times.
