Key Insights
1. Satisfaction Rating Distribution
Observation: Most calls have a satisfaction rating of 3/5, indicating neutral customer experiences.
Action: Investigate causes for lack of highly satisfied (5/5) ratings and explore methods to improve customer interaction.
2. Average Talk Duration by Topic
Observation: Topics like "Technical Support" and "Contract related" have longer talk durations.
Action: Streamline agent workflows for these topics to reduce call duration and enhance efficiency.
3. Speed of Answer vs. Satisfaction Rating
Observation: Calls with shorter response times (<90 seconds) generally achieve higher satisfaction ratings.
Action: Set a service level agreement (SLA) target to keep response times under 90 seconds to maintain high customer satisfaction.
4. Call Distribution by Weekday and Hour
Observation: Peak call volumes occur on weekdays between 9 AM-12 PM and 4 PM-6 PM.
Action: Adjust staffing levels to match peak hours and optimize resource allocation.
5. Agent Performance Analysis
Observation: Certain agents (e.g., "Becky" and "Diane") handle higher call volumes with consistent satisfaction ratings.
Action: Identify and replicate best practices from top-performing agents to train others.
6. Topics with Low Resolutions
Observation: Topics like "Payment related" and "Technical Support" have lower resolution rates.
Action: Provide additional training or resources to improve resolution rates for these challenging topics.
7. Customer Pain Points
Observation: Low satisfaction ratings correlate with long response times and unresolved issues.
Action: Investigate unresolved cases and optimize agent workflows to address inefficiencies and improve customer satisfaction.
Visualizations
Visualizations were created to help better interpret the data and support the insights:

Satisfaction Rating Distribution: A pie chart showing the breakdown of satisfaction ratings.

Impact: Quick visualization of overall customer satisfaction.
Average Talk Duration by Topic: A boxplot to compare the average call durations across different topics.

Impact: Clearly shows the variance in call durations, with some topics requiring more time.
Speed of Answer vs. Satisfaction Rating: A scatter plot or boxplot showing how quicker answers impact customer satisfaction.

Impact: Visualization highlighting that faster responses correlate with higher satisfaction.
Call Distribution by Weekday and Hour: A heatmap showing call volume distribution by time of day and day of the week.

Impact: Helps in staffing decisions by highlighting peak hours.
Agent Performance: A bar chart or scatter plot to show agents' performance in terms of call volume and satisfaction.

Impact: Identifies high-performing agents and areas of improvement.
